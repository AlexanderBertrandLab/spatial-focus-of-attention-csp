## About

This repository includes the MATLAB code for the subject-specific CSP decoder as explained in [1]. [mainSubjectSpecific.m](mainSubjectSpecific.m) contains the main script, which works by default with the dataset published in https://zenodo.org/record/3997352#.X0y1B3kzZEY. The [preprocessData.m](preprocessData.m)-script can be used to preprocess the data, downloaded from the aforementioned link, and replaces the function of the same name at https://zenodo.org/record/3997352#.X0y1B3kzZEY. 

Developed and tested in MATLAB R2020a.
